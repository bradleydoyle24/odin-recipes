# odin-recipes
A recipe website for Project Odin's first HTML assignment.

This assignment was given after learning some basics of the command-line-interface (CLI), HTML, Git, and VSCode.  Some basic CLI commands were taught, such as how to make directories/files, copy and remove directories/files, and how to use Git with the CLI. 
For HTML, a basic 'boilerplate' HTML setup was taught, along with the basics of elements and tags with their appropriate attributes. Some simple text structures like paragraphs, headings, and lists were introduced.  'Strong' and 'em' elements were explained and their proper use, as well as how to link images and other webpages to our current webpage.
The protocol for modifying, staging, committing, and pushing files in VSCode was explained.

The goal is to apply all of these introductory concepts in making a basic recipe website.
