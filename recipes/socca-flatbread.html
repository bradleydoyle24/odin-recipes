        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This <em>easy</em> flatbread is made with chickpea flour, which is high in protein and fiber. It requires no kneading- <em>you simply add water to it and leave for 30 minutes!</em> It is fried in a similar way as pancakes.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>9 oz chickpea flour</li>
            <li>A pinch of salt</li>
            <li>14 fl oz water</li>
            <li>Pinch of bicarbonate of soda (or baking powder)</li>
            <li>1 red onion, cut into wedges</li>
            <li>1 red or yellow pepper, deseeded and sliced</li>
            <li>1 courgette, sliced of the diagonal</li>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for cooking</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
            <li>2 tbsp pesto</li>
            <li>2-3 large tomatoes, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>A handful of black olives</li>
            <li>3&#189; oz mozzarella, sliced</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>To Serve:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>A leafy salad</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the chickpea flour and salt in a bowl.  Gradually whisk in the water (an electric mixer helps).  Let batter stand for 30 minutes until it is smooth and thick.</li>
            <li>Once thick, stir in the bicarbonate of soda or baking powder.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400&#176;F.</li>
            <li>Toss onion, pepper, courgette slices, and garlic with the olive oil in a large roasting tin so they are well-coated.  Roast in the oven for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat a little oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat.  Pour in a ladleful of batter. Swirl around pan to coat.</li>
            <li>Cook batter for 2 minutes, flip, and then cook the other side for 1-2 minutes. Slide onto an oiled baking tray.  Repeat to use all the batter.</li>
            <li>Spread the pesto over the socca base, then arrange tomato slices and roasted vegetables on top.</li>
            <li>Scatter olives and cheese over top.</li>
            <li>Bake in oven for 5-7 minutes until the cheese has melted and socca is crisp at the edges. Serve with a leafy salad.</li>
        </ol>
